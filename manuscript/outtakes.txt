the sting operation that is in place relative to election interference. 

Remember that election interference  were the two key words  on  Trump's so called mugshot  that 

was circulated  hundreds of millions of times on Twitter  and probably hundreds of millions of times more  on other platforms thereafter. 

Only one day after  his interview with Tucker Carlson  received a quarter million views as well.

and this executive order were, though, were not something I would dig into  for quite some time. But. 

When Colonel Waldron brought up Executive Order 13848, that was the seed,  and a big clue that, although it may have registered a bit,  left,  I was left untouched  by 

my general lack of understanding of the entire situation.  In other words,  I had more to learn. 

Before I left the building that day, I spoke with another young man.  I believe from Ohio.  And he asked me  how things were going.  And I said that  I was inspired to go get an audit in Minnesota.  And he said,  That's fine, but how are you going to do that?  And honestly, I had no idea.
