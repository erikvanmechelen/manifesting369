# INITIAL IDEA TO INCLUDE MORE YEARS... MAYBE THAT COMES LATER...

GET FIRST BOOK OUT FIRST

first act - 2020
second act - 2021-2022
third act - 2022-2023 (and 2024?)

first act
inciting incident - 2020, in Pennsylvania, 1000 steps, cnn in living room non-stop, ugly: argument about race... kelly says i shouldn't say what liz does, what i allow her to do, valid, but i was upset about election and knew something was wrong... pent up anger from 2020, let it out on our friends instead of peacefully 
complication - vaccines?
rising action - audits, cyber symposium
climax - "nothing" happens there
resolution - time to learn (from Rick)

second act
inciting incident - Andrei says, run for Secretary of State
complication - can't get in
rising action - decide to run 
climax - the election itself
resolution - win without winning...? redefining winning

third act - never give up
inciting incident - derek johnson
complication - still have two parties, corrupt
rising action ... 
climax ...
resolution ...

this is one way to do it...

could also simply focus on the 96 days of campaign
and then use 
backlook and forecast 
(flashback/flashforward)
as needed to give context, beats, etc.
