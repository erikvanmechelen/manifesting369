For me, the beginning of this story probably took place at the Cyber Symposium. 

In days leading up to the event, where Mike Lindell promised to reveal significant PCAP (packet capture) data, I helped a small group to advertise and invite legislators. Seven showed up from Minnesota, the most of any state. (They were not at that time convinced of the problems or solutions.) 

The Cyber Symposium took place in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, over the course of three days, August 10, 11, and 12  of 2021. 

I got a lift there from someone named Chris. I stood next to a wooden staple-infested street lamp on the morning of August 9, a Monday. When a gray car pulled up, I waved, and after it came to a stop, I opened the passenger door, extended my hand to shake the driver's. After putting my luggage in the backseat I sat down and gave Chris sixty dollars for fuel, the least I could do since I had no other way to get to Sioux Falls. With that we turned left at the corner of Chicago and 56th, eighteen blocks south of a world famous intersection where not far from Powderhorn Park a powder keg had been set off, and made for the highway. 

Talking to Chris was refreshing after so far interacting only anonymously online with others seeking an audit of Minnesota's 2020 general election. Chris was a computer expert, and so was one of about sixty people invited to look at Lindell's data. As for me, I was invited through the admin of a Telegram channel of which Chris and I were both a part. 

I had stumbled upon this group, called Minnesota First Audit, a few months after downloading the Telegram app. For those unfamiliar with the platform, Telegram not only provides channels for broadcasting information with or without comments enabled, but also provides working spaces called groups which were used to educate and organize on the topic of election audits. Shortly after joining the channel, I volunteered to become a moderator, and shortly thereafter was picked to be the communications lead.

I didn't know why I was invited, but I said yes within a breath of being asked. And soon enough I was in a car heading for a meeting of minds on election reform.

The next four hours, I got to know Chris and he got to know me. He asked why I was going there, which I didn't have a good answer to, except that I was eager to learn more. He suggested I introduce myself as an independent reporter and ask people why they were there.

During the next three days, there  were a variety of interesting  interactions, presentations, as well as twists and turns one would expect from your average spy thriller. 

For the time being, though, I will mostly set aside the Cyber Symposium. 

Before doing so, it's important to consider that the PCAPs may or may not have been as advertised (I was not part of the data group that was promised access), but also that there can be more than meets the eye in these settings. The world also met Tina Peters, as documented in Selection Code, the Mesa County Clerk from Colorado which took a before and after image of her Dominion Voting Systems Election Management System server for both the 2020 general election and the 2021 Grand Junction municipal election. 

On the third day of the Cyber Symposium, after all the presentations were over, after I'd met and shaken Mike Lindell's hand, thanking him, I noticed Colonel Philip Waldron (retired, Army) standing in the entry hall. 

Before I could get to him, someone else struck up a conversation. If I recall, it was another Colonel who on Day Two shared some interesting war stories with me. While Kim and I waited patiently. Draza Smith walked by. I said hello, gave her a big hug, and thanked her for her hard work.

She had the previous day given a short update on the cruise control theory, as well as  worked alongside Col. Shawn Smith, Patrick Colbeck, and Mark Cook to set up the mock election where, for the first time, I saw how simple it was to electronically manipulate an election.

When it was my turn to speak with Col. Waldron, I asked him a question that was prompted by a friend of mine, Andrei, in a phone call the night before. 

Andrei had said these kind of meetings are where the seeds of new ideas can grow, and that therefore it was important to call out the election for what it was, and then call for new elections.

So I asked Col. Waldron, If we do our audits and find...

That we've been duped, he finished my sentence. 

Yes, I said. Then, after that, what is stopping us from immediately calling for new elections?  

Nothing, he said. 

And that was that.

Earlier that day, Col. Waldron had on mentioned Executive Order 13848: Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United States Election. I don't remember what he said about it, although a recording of that talk can be found online. This Executive Order was signed by President Trump (now Commander-in-Chief Trump) on September 12, 2018. It was continued on September 10, 2019, again on September 10, 2020, then, unexpectedly to some, again by Mr. Biden on September 7, 2021, September 7, 2022, and September 7, 2023. The Executive Order contains the following words, "...constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security..." 

Day One's video showing the financial ties certain companies had to the Chinese Communist Party also, in retrospect, seem to connect directly or indirectly to not only Executive Order 13848, but also Executive Order 13959: Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies, which again uses the phrasing, "constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat." My brief experience in China, primarily in the capital, Beijing, starting at age 17, in 2005, which may have helped me make basic sense of that Executive Order, is discussed in the introduction of another book, (S)elections in Minnesota, written during the course of about three weeks and published on June 26, 2022.

Also of note during the Cyber Symposium was a brief interaction with Representative Eric Lucero as well as with Representative Erik Mortensen, sitting apart from the others. Chris was able to set up a meeting between Representative Mortensen and Dr. Frank on Day Three. I would learn not quite a year later in a conversation at the Republication Party of Minnesota Congressional District 3 convention, that not much came from that meeting, which may have turned Erik away from focusing on election reform. Of all the then current and 2022 class of legislators, perhaps only Representaives Nathan Wesenberg and Ben Davis have mustered the courage to speak clearly on the topic.

While this recap of the week in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has been brief, I'll reserve the option to expand the Cyber Symposium at times in this book or in later books, given in part that I had a unique vantage as one of a handful of men and women present at all three of Mike Lindell's events, including the Cyber Symposium, The Moment of Truth Summit, and the Election Crime Bureau, as well as being a speaker at the latter two events, giving me the freedom to explore behind the curtain. I'll not soon forget, for instance, on Day One of The Moment of Truth Summit, when being shown backstage by Melody to find Patrick Colbeck, we followed Col. Shawn Smith (retired, Air Force, with over 25 years active duty in space and missile operations, and more) for a few steps before he stopped, turned to me, said, "Who are you?" (the only three words he ever said to me), and after receiving my reply, "Erik van Mechelen from Minnesota", carried on without further comment. Interactions like that reminded me to pay attention to how military and former military men and women operated. Even with the military occupation and continuity of operations plan, there were plenty of capable veterans and civilians joining hands to give their service beyond service or to do their civic duty.

Before I left the building that day, I spoke with another young man from a Midwestern state. He asked me what would come next, to which I responded that I was inspired to go get an audit in Minnesota. And he said, That's fine, but how are you going to do that?  To be fair, I had no idea.
