On April 13th at 8:48 in the morning, the year of Our Lord 2022, I was still six days from making my first public speech on elections. At that time, I'd only for six months seriously studied the process, procedures, systems, and laws related to this sacred democratic process of choosing representatives in our constitutional republic. And in less than a fortnight, I would be asked to run for Minnesota Secretary of State. That invitation changed my life.

From my formal announcement, standing on the tailgate of a pickup truck outside the Sherburne County Government Center, on May 4th, it would only be 96 days before the results of the 2022 primary election were broadcast, where, running against the Republican Party of Minnesota candidate, as a republican, some were surprised. (cluster sentence!)

Before jumping into that story, these words ought to be put in their proper context. 

Approaching the halfway point of 2022 meant the war formally declared on December 20, 2019, as seen In 50 U.S. Code ยง1550, to protect and defend our constitution, was already in its third year. The world's allied militaries would have made their plans well in advance of that date, as indicated by the so-called Capitulation Tour of 2017.

Of course, at that time, I had not yet read Derek Johnson's first book, The Midnight Rider Rides Again. And even as I write now, I haven't read the book, as it is expected later in December or in January of 2024.

But as I write this now, it is the eve of December 20th, 2023, which marks the four-year anniversary of not only that formal war declaration but also the inauguration of the United States Space Force.

In 2022, I didn't understand the global sting operation in the same way that I do now, having since done a fair bit of reading, studying, and thinking.

What I cared about in 2022, at times to a fault, was helping as many people as possible learn what I'd learned about how our elections, our sacred elections, can be manipulated in order to determine election outcomes. Is there better way to take over a country?

On April 19th I would speak in the Sherburne County Commissioner meeting. But before we go there, let's start at the beginning.
