I think it was Shakespeare who said  all the world's a stage.  Suggesting that  men and women and children  were all just actors  in this life. 

And the question is, what story  are we playing a part of? 

But, 

was Shakespeare  even really Shakespeare?  Or,  was Shakespeare  A creation  of a group  managed by Sir Francis Bacon, 

an early example  of  narrative control.  Perhaps. 

It's a reminder.  I, I, I bring this up  because  throughout the story I will mention various names. 

Those names 

strike me as important in some way for them to be included, 

but the reader should be wary of  assigning  too much value  or connotation to 

their inclusion. 

For instance, 

a name may be brought up. 

As a contributor of a particular piece of information  to the way that I understand elections. 

But  it does not follow  that  that individual is necessarily one of the good guys. 

Because I happen to learn that piece of information from him. 

The simple fact is,  from my perspective,  with 

my still nascent research capabilities,  that 

it takes  some effort and time 

to sort out what people are up to, 

and certainly on the national stage, for instance, in Congress, 

where I am persuaded, again, by Derek Johnson's work,  which points to Federal Continuity Directives 1 and 2, that there is a Continuity of Operations Plan  in place,  and therefore, there is some  necessary  Stage acting 

taking place  in order to  essentially  keep the piece and keep things appearing as though they are going along. 

Now, I do not know how many of the people that I've interacted with are essentially actors. 

But, 

I did try to apply what a friend  offered me,  what a friend Nathan offered me, 

which was a checklist, 

which included 

investigating  someone's motivations. 

I made  quite a few decisions about who to interact with based upon 

Clear, or 

based upon a,  an understanding of their stated or shown motivations. 

Once again,  to emphasize,  in order to get  close to an enemy, it would require that one look like  and  feel like  one of those.  And so,  I'm not going to spend a lot of time,  I'm going to spend little time,  in this story,  of trying to sort that out. 

Even though, 

sorting that out, 

is important, 

to some degree, to avoid  falling into traps.
