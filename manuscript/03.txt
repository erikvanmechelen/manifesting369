I think it was Shakespeare who said  all the world's a stage.  Suggesting that  men and women and children  were all just actors  in this life. 

And the question is, what story  are we playing a part of? 

But, 

was Shakespeare  even really Shakespeare?  Or,  was Shakespeare  A creation  of a group  managed by Sir Francis Bacon, 

an early example  of  narrative control.  Perhaps. 

It's a reminder.  I, I, I bring this up  because  throughout the story I will mention various names. 

Those names 

strike me as important in some way for them to be included, 

but the reader should be wary of  assigning  too much value  or connotation to 

their inclusion. 

For instance, 

a name may be brought up. 

As a contributor of a particular piece of information  to the way that I understand elections. 

But  it does not follow  that  that individual is necessarily one of the good guys. 

Because I happen to learn that piece of information from him. 

The simple fact is,  from my perspective,  with 

my still nascent research capabilities,  that 

it takes  some effort and time 

to sort out what people are up to, 

and certainly on the national stage, for instance, in Congress, 

where I am persuaded, again, by Derek Johnson's work,  which points to Federal Continuity Directives 1 and 2, that there is a Continuity of Operations Plan  in place,  and therefore, there is some  necessary  Stage acting 

taking place  in order to  essentially  keep the piece and keep things appearing as though they are going along. 

Now, I do not know how many of the people that I've interacted with are essentially actors. 

But, 

I did try to apply what a friend  offered me,  what a friend Nathan offered me, 

which was a checklist, 

which included 

investigating  someone's motivations. 

I made  quite a few decisions about who to interact with based upon 

Clear, or 

based upon a,  an understanding of their stated or shown motivations. 

Once again,  to emphasize,  in order to get  close to an enemy, it would require that one look like  and  feel like  one of those.  And so,  I'm not going to spend a lot of time,  I'm going to spend little time,  in this story,  of trying to sort that out. 

Even though, 

sorting that out, 

is important, 

to some degree, to avoid  falling into traps.

​BUT ONE PERSON I DO HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT IS... RICK WEIBLE 
(below pasted from 01_chapter_one.txt in midwestseeds visualstudio)

This was how I joined one of America's largest investigations.

It was evening on October 13, 2021 at the Ramsey City Hall. Incredibly, almost a year had passed since November 3, 2020, and my education was only just beginning: finally, I'd decided to attend an in-person event about election reform.

There I soon met Teri, who was organizing this ‘I Thought I Voted’-sponsored event, where Rick would soon present. The videographer was missing, and since there was a newly-purchased video camera hanging around my neck I offered to take his place. I was new to this, though: from a chair near the front, stage right, without a tripod, the camera shook a bit in my hands as Rick began to speak.

Before and since, to a variety of audiences, Rick has described himself as a tax refugee from Minnesota, living just over the border in South Dakota. In the aughts and teens, he was on the city council and then mayor of a small town, St. Bonifacius, on the edge Hennepin County, MN. In 2016 hacked into the converted iPads during KnowInk's epollbook pitch and therefore declined the contract (the only municipality in the county to do so). In addition to a comprehension of election equipment, election statutes, and election process and procedures, his involvement in the Minnesota Republican Party gave him political experience. And he also knew about computers. If they worked, he said, he wouldn't have a computer security business. Rick is humble, kind, competent, and stands in a Biblical foundation, occasionally quoting the likes of James 1:25 in an inviting way. But don't let your compassionate nature fool you. He is more than capable of expressing himself and perhaps only temperance has stayed his hand when others may have lost their cool. 

Since that time, Rick did many things, perhaps most significant of which was working with a team which succeeded in getting ES&S executives at the Nebraska headquarters to admit that cast vote record functionality does in fact exist in all their tabulators. Rick was also, ironically it could be said, *appointed* to city council in Elkton and in November 2023 filed to run for South Dakota House of Representatives in 2024.

That evening way back in 2021 he spoke first about expectations that the public has, or should have, from local government. Expectations may be justifiably low, but why shouldn't they be high? And is it not true that how the government runs elections is an indicator of how well everything else is done?

Of particular interest to me was the fact that on November 29, 2020, about 734,000 absentee ballots were not connected with voters in the Statewide Voter Registration System 25 days after the election, and worse, five days after the Minnesota State Canvassing Board had certified Minnesota's results. (It is not required in statute for this to be done, but it is unclear how the results could be verified properly without such basic work being complete, in particular once learning that it takes a few computer clicks, at most, to accomplish this task.)

Since that night, Rick and I have spoken reguarly, if not often, after he started to share more about what he was up to when I started going to commissioner meetings in Dakota County. Mostly, I have reported on the work he has done and the work he has inspired others to do.

Chatting with Teri after, she asked if I knew the shorter woman who had happened to walk in the same time as me (we weren't together), because early on in the talk she had from the front row turned around and scanned the room with her phone. This was a reminder that this work was going to involve some interesting characters, a reality already experienced at the Cyber Symposium.

Before leaving, I'd hoped to thank Rick for his presentation and more properly introduce myself, but there was another man in a lengthy discussion with him. I didn't know him then, but it was Tom, who would later become the Elections Manager in Anoka County. I also didn't know then that I was to spend a bit of time at the Anoka County Government Center alongside the Anoka County Election Integrity Team (ACEIT). But that would come almost 15 months later at the beginning of 2023.

Not long after, I attended an event in Rosemount put on by Bill where Rick was joined by Susan. I learned later these two spoke often on the phone, which made sense given their backgrounds and areas of expertise. Susan provided much-needed expertise on Minnesota Statutes, often filling an entire slide with text. At first I wondered whether it might be easier to pull snippets from the statutes to focus our attention, but later I realized that the context is key. Just as it is fraught to take Bible verses out of context, statutes should be read carefully to fully take in the language, definitions, and terminology.
